On several occasions, this pillar is scheduled to be removed for development, but on each occasion the person who was supposed to remove it died unexpectedly. A few years ago a driver lost control of his car and bumped into the pillar. He was dead in his car when the police arrived, but the accident was not life threatening.

If you paid her price, she would help you cross over the ridges. The locals left her alone and occasionally called upon her during a drought. The witch died of natural causes around 1850.

Older employees talk about things being moved, odd knocking and footsteps on the stairwell after the close of business, and opening up the business in the morning to find closed/locked desk drawers opened.  Most recently, two employees were standing in the upstairs landing in broad daylight talking when they heard an odd knocking coming from one of the interior closets near the window that is near the attic. One of the police department canines visibly refuses to enter a downstairs conference room that was originally a formal dining room. Little John was at first thought to be some sort of myth created by one of the former patrol division members to delight and scare the female staff members, but some current and some retired employees can tell of the oddities that have sometimes occurred in the house.  \"Little John\" was supposedly a son of one of the Braseltons that had some slight mental problems. Little John allegedly occupied the house for a while and used to pick up stray dogs as pet.  He and the dogs mostly resided in the attic until his death. Although rarely talked about, there is also a report of one of the former Braselton matrons being seen in the downstairs bathroom. Prior to the house becoming the Town Hall, it was sometimes used for wedding receptions and other events. Supposedly, a guest at one of the weddings proclaimed to be a psychic and he told of seeing people dressed in formal attire from the twenties standing in the hall and of seeing the Braselton female in and around the bathroom. Being that no harm ever seems to be done, some of the employees just laugh when things occur and write it off as Little John being in the house.

Some say it's the ghost of an unknown man whose head was severed in a train accident. He swings a lantern in a futile search for his missing part. Others say the \"light\" is the glow of the lantern swung by two lovers in their effort to stop the train late at night. Their parents forbid them to see each other, thus they planned this escape but were shot by her father who thought they were prowlers. The \"light\" is a ghostly reminder of their tragic love.",

An old barn is still present in the woods, and sounds can be heard at night. While in the barn at night visions of dead slaves can be seen through the old windows and witnesses have given first hand testimony of seeing Colonel Gray riding his horse around the barn warning trespassers to stay away. Slaves have been seen wandering the road late at night.- May 2004 additional information: If you stop there and turn off your lights and put your car in neutral, you will begin to roll very slowly, at times it feels as though you are being rocked, very strange, Though it doesn't happen every time. One group had to try 5 or 6 times before anything happened. Sounds of something walking on the bridge and in the creek have been reported. Reports of an oval shaped black shadow walk towards the car. -  JUly 2005 Update: The bridge is no longer there.",

If you crank your car, without turning on your lights, and begin to drive off, the man will chase you until you are off the bridge. Then the ghost will disappear into the night. The ghost is there to try to scare people off the bridge so that they won't face the same fate that the couple did. BEWARE: The ghost doesn't always walk right to your car.

   "description": "This Inn was built in 1790 and is haunted by a girl named Anna She was a seventeen year old girl who was shunned after getting pregnant by a sailor. The sailor was said to have jumped out of the third story window and died. He haunts the same room the window was located. Guests claim to lose things such as wallets, ID's, and underclothes. They will later be found in planters or behind bookshelves. People have also reported hearing Anna in the room moving things around. -  December 2003 Update/ Correction: The story is that she was in love with a sailor, but HE did NOT jump from the window... SHE DID. (He had gone to sea and was not there to throw himself out of a window) She was deeply depressed because he was going to sea and leaving her, most likely never to return. It is said that she could see the sails of his boat as it went down river and out to sea. She threw herself from a 3rd floor window. There is also said to be a woman who haunts the kitchen in the inn who used to practice voodoo, and a spirit haunts the bar/restaurant area. The submitter claims to have taken photos throughout the inn, but have not caught any anomalies on film. However, when they tried taking pictures in the bar area, their camera suddenly failed to work. Once they left the area, the camera functioned with no problem. They also had to buy new batteries twice in one weekend, as if something had drained them. On the second floor a linen closet, they felt a foreboding presence. Later, when talking to a housekeeper at the inn, they were told she had had a dream once of a man clad in 1700's clothing coming out of that same closet. She had no idea that they had a really creepy feeling each time they walked by it. The second time they stayed at the 1790's they remarked to the clerk as they checked in, that at least they weren't going to have to sleep in \"Anna's room\". The clerk told them that the window she threw herself from was not actually her bedroom at the time... her bedroom was room 101... which is the room they was staying in! When they reached the room and preceded to unlock the door, it wouldn't open. Both she and her husband tried, the bottom lock was unlocked, but the deadbolt wasn't. They had knocked on the door, jokingly saying, \"Anna... come on, open up.\" They returned to the innkeeper and she went up with us to check out the problem. She informed them that the deadbolts could only be locked from the inside and the innkeeper has a master key for those. She pushed down on the door handle and the door opened with no problem! It was if the deadbolt had never been locked, yet they BOTH knew that it had been. The 1790's Inn (is actually spelled out as Seventeen Hundred Ninety's Inn, in case you want to search the net for it) is most definitely filled with an atmosphere of spirits from the past, you can feel it all around you if you are sensitive to that kind of thing. They heard noises in the room at night, and guests have been known to leave in the middle of the night after seeing apparitions and hearing strange sounds.",

The Old Gunn church (accurate name is Prince Frederick's Church) ruins are not in Murrells Inlet, SC but is located on highway SC22-4 off US 701 about 16 miles north of Georgetown, SC. The book \"Ghosts of Georgetown\" gives a good accounting of the events of this church and its history but there are variations of the story. One version: During the building of the church Mr. Gunn (who was either an architect or Overseer of the slaves) was in the bell tower. It is believed he was an Overseer because when he fell he was not dead and the slaves refused to approach or help him. They feared him so much for his evil ways they ran away and left him to die alone, cursing them. The church was finally finished but had a tragic history and was finally abandoned. They say he haunts the area. Witnesses report the air is very heavy and thick though the ruins are in the open with pine trees around the area.

   "description": "The Story goes that a woman had a husband that was a conductor for a railroad company in Summerville...and he worked nights. At midnight every night, people could always see her there, waiting by the tracks with his lunch and a lantern...waiting for him to stop to eat. One night, he never showed. She was told that the train had derailed or crashed, and he was beheaded and, of course, killed. Although they buried his remains, she would never accept the fact that he was gone, and so, she went to the tracks at midnight with her lantern and walked up and down, waiting for him. People of course began to think she was crazy, but she continued this nightly ritual until her own death. Mysteriously, the light never stopped coming. This is what my mother told me happens at her visit to THE SUMMERVILLE LIGHT: When you go to the tracks, just before midnight, you can hear all the sounds that are usually heard at night, crickets chirping, frogs croaking...the breeze blowing.... but for some odd reason, and this has been the case for every person who has seen THE LIGHT...at midnight, the sounds suddenly just cease. As if a presence has quieted them momentarily. Then you can see it, usually its far off, a light and nothing else...coming your way. If you stick around, THE LIGHT will chase you. Scared visitors tried to jump in their car and leave and the light came upon them swiftly, and they heard a BUMP on their car, as they sped away. When at a safe distance from the sighting, they got out and looked, and there was a dent on the car, where the lantern hit it. Others have had their car stalled and even a report of having a strange burn mark on their hood. - May 2008 Update: The Summerville end of this road is completely blocked off by dirt mounds and is impassable. Also the police keep a good eye on that area and will show up and detain you. Recently a group was detained had their car searched, and were told to leave because \"its a dangerous area\".",
